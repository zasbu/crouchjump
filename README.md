# crouchjump
A simple crouch jump script that uncrouches for you after a specified time and releases the "w" key on jump.
Now you can hold space without being crouched!

(The default timing should give you enough time to crouch over start platforms and uncrouch before you hit any ramps)
Make sure your crouch jump key is only bound to +jump, this won't work if you have your crouch jump bind on!
