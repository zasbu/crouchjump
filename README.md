# crouchjump
A simple crouch jump script that uncrouches for you after a specified time and releases the "w" key on jump.

Now you can hold space without being crouched!

(The default timing should give you enough time to crouch over start platforms and uncrouch before you hit any ramps)

Make sure your crouch jump key is only bound to +jump, this won't work if you have your crouch jump bind on!

You can set a custom hotkey in config.ini that will work in-game now. I recommend setting a key that you don't use in typing, like a function key (f1, f2, f3 etc.)

You need to have the program in focus to pause/unpause the script with enter as your keybind, otherwise you can pause it while tabbed in-game with a custom keybind.
