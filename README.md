# CrouchJump

CrouchJump is a simple script that automates the crouch jump action in games. It automatically releases the crouch key after a specified time delay and also releases the "W" key on jump.

## Features

- Allows you to hold the spacebar without being crouched.
- Default timing provides enough time to crouch over start platforms and uncrouch before hitting any ramps.
- Works best when your spacebar is only bound to "+jump".

## Usage

1. Download the latest release.
2. Make sure your spacebar is only bound to "+jump" in the game settings.
3. Customize the script behavior by modifying the `config.ini` file.
   - Set a custom hotkey for pausing/unpausing the script in-game.
   - Recommended key choices are function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) or keys that are not used while typing.
   - Set your +duck key, by default this is left ctrl.
   - If you keep the pause key as enter you need the script program in focus to be able to pause/unpause the script.
4. Run the script.
5. Press the designated hotkey to pause/unpause the script in-game.
   - Note: If you're tabbed into the game, you can use the custom hotkey to pause the script.

## Notes

- Don't forget to pause or close the script when you're not playing to avoid any interference with typing.
- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.
